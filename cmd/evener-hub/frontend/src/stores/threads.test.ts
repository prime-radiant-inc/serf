// the caller instead converges through the "adopt a replacement read already in

// callback, by contrast, is specified to run only after the microtask
// checkpoint has drained completely, including microtasks queued by other
// microtasks. So this holds however many turns that path grows.
//
// Its one boundary: it does not cover a future change that parks the caller
// behind a task or I/O of its own (an IndexedDB read on the rejection path,
